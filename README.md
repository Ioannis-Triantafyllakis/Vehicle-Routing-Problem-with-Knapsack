# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-with-Knapsack
In this project, i find the optimal routes of **5 cargo trucks** starting from a **cental warehouse**.</br> 
</br>
The algorithms used in this project are the **Vehicle Routing Problem** with the **Minimum Insertions** method and the **Knapsack Problem**.</br>
</br>
In every route, each truck serves a number of customers, and has a maximum "serving" capacity. Each truck also chooses which customers to serve according to a profit to cost ratio (The knapsack problem) since not all customers can be served. </br>
</br>
When the final solution is found, it gets further improved with a **Variable Neighborhood Descent Algorithm** (which includes **Swap Move** and **Relocation Move** of the customers already chosen). The aim of VND is to decrease the cost of the exisiting solution.</br>
